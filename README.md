# uwx/MagicStorage
This is a fork of [MagicStorage](https://github.com/blushiemagic/MagicStorage), a Terraria mod for mass storing items.
The only change in the fork was increasing the number of crafting stations for the Crafting Access item from 10 to 15.

See the original [README](https://github.com/blushiemagic/MagicStorage#magic-storage) for more details.
